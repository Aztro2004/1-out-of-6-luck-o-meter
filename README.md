# 1 out of 6 luck-o-meter

A program that measures your luck of  with a chance of 1 out of 6. The program creates a random number between 1 and 6, and you have to guess it, if you guessed right the program will tell you and will save a value that saves the luck of that happening according to the number of tries. The program has 4 main inputs or commands:
1. Num. between 1 and 6: your guess of the number between 1 and 6 the computer generates.
2. 'PRINT': Displays a graph of your luck with each try up to the point you type the command.
3. 'RESTART': Resets the program and all your previous data.
4. 'EXIT': Ends the program.

## How is your luck calculated?
With each right guess you get it will get taken into account with the number of tries up to that point. the general formula is:
- num of right guesses / num of tries. 

and the result of that is compred to the number of tries, to see the increase and decrease of your luck in the span of all your attempts.
